# float_flavors
Lots of different svgs to use them in html files
## why we do not use png format?
the reason is that the png format is very heavy and this very bad for your web site speed so we made a thing called float flavors that is using svg . svg is very light and it will not make your web site slow.
# why float flavors?
firstly, as we said svg is very light and secondly,float flavors has colorful svgs too.the another reason is that learning float flavors is very easy
