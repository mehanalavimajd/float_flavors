# float_flavors
Lots of different svgs to use them in html files
## why we do not use png format?
the reason is that the png format is very heavy and this is very bad for your website speed so we made a thing called float flavors that is using svg . svg is very light and it will not make your website slow.
# why float flavors?
firstly, as we said svg is very light and secondly,float flavors has colorful svgs too.the another reason is that learning float flavors is very easy
# how we can use float flavors  ?
First of all please copy the svg directory and float_flavors.css and paste them in the direcrory that you like . Secondly make index.html (if you do not like this name, change it :) )
and link the float_flavors.css to it.Then paste this code in index.html
```<div class="clock threex"></div> ```or ```<div class="ff clock threex"></div>```
 Ok,reload the page and as  you can see a clock appears on page.

## but , why we use the "clock" in here?
well , if you want a cloud you have to write "cloud" in here or when you want an arrow you have to write "arrow" in here , or anything else
## what is this "threex"
onex , twox , threex, fourx and fivex are about sizes. please check width & height.txt  for mor information :)
## what is not same between .ff and without .ff
nothing but imagine that your project is creating a clock so if you use .ff you won't be confused any more
